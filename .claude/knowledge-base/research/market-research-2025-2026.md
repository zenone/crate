## 7. Specific Feature Ideas (Competitive Edge)

### 1. Multi-Source Metadata Lookup (HIGH PRIORITY)
Query Beatport, MusicBrainz, Discogs simultaneously. Display results side-by-side. User selects best match. Save preferences per field.

**Competitive Advantage**: OneTagger does this but has poor UX

### 2. Filename Pattern Learning (AI Feature)
Analyze existing well-organized files, detect patterns, suggest templates automatically.

**Competitive Advantage**: No current tool does this intelligently

### 3. Duplicate Detection by Audio Fingerprint
Use AcoustID/Chromaprint. Find same song across formats/bitrates. Safe removal keeping highest quality.

**Competitive Advantage**: Only Lexicon has this (expensive)

### 4. Metadata Conflict Resolution UI
When sources disagree, show all options, user decides. Learn preferences.

**Competitive Advantage**: Most tools just overwrite blindly

### 5. Template Marketplace
Community-driven template library by genre/style. "Download standard house template". Share templates. Upvote/downvote.

**Competitive Advantage**: No tool has this

### 6. Rekordbox/Serato Integration
Update DJ software database after renaming. Preserve playlists. Verify integrity. Automatic backups.

**Competitive Advantage**: Only Lexicon does this well (charges premium)

### 7. Undo/Rollback System
Save state before batch operations. "Undo last 500 renames" in one click. Show diff preview.

**Competitive Advantage**: Critical for trust

### 8. Label & Catalog Number Management
Specialized fields for record labels. Extract from filename patterns. Organize by label.

**Competitive Advantage**: Rarely done well, critical for vinyl DJs

   - Rekordbox/Serato integration
   - Template marketplace with DJ-standard defaults
   - Undo/rollback system

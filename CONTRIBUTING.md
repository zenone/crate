# Contributing

This is a personal template repo.

## Principles
- Keep root prompts short (avoid context bloat)
- Prefer small, verifiable changes
- Keep the template stack-agnostic; put stack specifics in `variants/`

## Checklist
- Update README/USAGE if behavior changes
- Ensure `.claude/` auto-loaded rules remain focused
